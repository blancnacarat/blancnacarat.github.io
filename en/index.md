		<blockquote><b> We are a young and independant label for musicians, film-makers, writers, photographers and designers.
		<br>
		<p class="logo" style="padding-left: 0em; padding-right: 0em; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong> Blanc Nacarat&nbsp;</strong></p>is about being as diversified as possible since we work not only with musicians within the electronic music area but also with artists whom work is based on other supports in order to deliver a young, various and dynamic cultural offer by mixing as many artforms as possible.
		</b></blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<b> Where are we heading ?
			<br>Our goal is to bring visibility to young artists to make their entrance in the professional world easier and, in the future, establish a collective which will be able to set up collective events and projects as well as supporting solo projects of their member.
			<br>We would like to see  <p class="logo" style="padding-left: 0em;padding-right: 0em;margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong> Blanc Nacarat&nbsp;</strong></p> grow into a true springboard and a family whose members could help each other, bond, connect, and share what they produce.
